I've found out a artistic-technological group named [AlgoRythmics](https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics/videos), they teach how the most popular sorting algorithms work.

You can read [the wikipedia topic Popular sorting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Popular_sorting_algorithms:lang:%20en),
although I think it isn\'t as funny to learn as the
[AlgoRythmics](https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics/videos) way.
Following the [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort),
judge for yourself.
