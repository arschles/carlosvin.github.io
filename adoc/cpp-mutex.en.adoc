Ease pthread mutex C++98 and a better C++11 mutex solution

link:[C++11] has added many improvements to help us developing multi-thread systems. I'm going to talk about link:[mutex].

In link:[previous C++11 compiler versions], we can get a link:[pthread] link:[mutex], but we must initialize and destroy in link:[C] style; in the end you must do more things than just lock/unlock.

link:[C++11] provides link:[mutex class], we just lock/unclock the object. I recommend you take a look at link:[C++11 mutex class].

If you still work with link:[previous C++11 compiler versions], a time ago, I made a wrapper class that helps to work with link:[pthread] link:[mutex]. You just lock/unlock the Mutex object.

Then I leave my code proposal (link:[Gist code]).
