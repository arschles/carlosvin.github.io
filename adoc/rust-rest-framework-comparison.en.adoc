REST frameworks for Rust Comparisson

I'm doing some experiments with link:[Rust] because it is a language that promises to be as fast as link:[C/C++], but safer in regards to memory management. Essentially, it doesn't allow the developer to do "bad things" with the memory like: forgetting release the memory that is not going to be used anymore or release memory if the developer is not the owner. In such scenarios, link:[Rust] won't compile.

Just for learning I've started a small project that offers a link:[REST] link:[API], so I've started looking for frameworks to ease/speed up the development. I've found a https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison[Rust web frameworks comparison]: https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison
