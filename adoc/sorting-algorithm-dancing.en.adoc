How sorting algorithms work, dancing and sorting

I've found out a artistic-technological group named link:[AlgoRythmics], they teach how the most popular sorting algorithms work.

You can read link:[the wikipedia topic Popular sorting algorithms], although I think it isn't as funny to learn as the link:[AlgoRythmics] way. Following the link:[Quicksort], judge for yourself.
